This Flutter app demonstrates how to perform REST API operations using the Dio package. It connects to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free mock API service, and implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## Features

- **GET Requests**: Fetch and display data from the server (e.g., posts, comments, users).
- **POST Requests**: Send new data to the server to create resources (e.g., add a new post).
- **PUT Requests**: Update existing resources by replacing them entirely.
- **PATCH Requests**: Partially update a resource with new data.
- **DELETE Requests**: Remove data from the server (e.g., delete a post).

## Project Setup

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
